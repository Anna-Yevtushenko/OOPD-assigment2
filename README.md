# Shapes blackboard

## Task üõ†Ô∏è

Develop a console-based application which will represent a shapes board with the ability to draw
different types of shapes on it. The main idea is that the user has an empty blackboard and can
interact with it in a few ways: show the blackboard, place or remove some shape within the
blackboard or clear it completely. Additionally, the user should be able to save and load the state
of the blackboard from the file

## Command-line Interface:

| Command  | Parameters      | Description                              | Result                                                    | Example              |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| draw     | -               | Draw blackboard to the console            | ASCII-drawn blackboard with all shapes on it, or empty     | `> draw`             |
| list     | -               | Print all added shapes with their IDs and parameters | List of all added shapes. One shape per line with shape ID and all information related to the shape | `> list` <br> `> id circle radius coordinates` <br> `> id square width height coordinates` |
| shapes   | -               | Print a list of all available shapes and parameters for the `add` command | List of all available shapes. One shape per line with shape info as defined by the student. | `> shapes` <br> `> circle radius coordinates` <br> `> square width height coordinates` |
| add      | shape parameters| Add shape to the blackboard               | Shape is added to the blackboard                           | `> add circle 10 10 5` |
| undo     | -               | Remove the last added shape from the blackboard | The last added shape is removed                          | `> undo`             |
| clear    | -               | Remove all shapes from the blackboard     | All shapes are removed from the blackboard                | `> clear`            |
| save     | file-path       | Save the blackboard to the file           | Blackboard is saved to the file. The state of the blackboard remains unchanged. | `> save D:\test.bb`  |
| load     | file-path       | Load a blackboard from the file           | Blackboard is loaded from the file. Previous state of the blackboard is cleared. | `> load D:\test.bb`  |






## Constrains: 
There are some constraints and preferences related to that task.
1. Shapes are drawn as frames.
2. Shapes can overlap. In that case, shapes should be correctly drawn.
3. Shapes cannot be placed outside of the board.
4. Shapes bigger than the board cannot be placed on the board.
5. Shapes that are partially outside of the board can be placed, but they are cropped.
6. Figures with the same type and parameters cannot be placed on the same spot.
7. There is no limit to the shape count on the board.
8. Empty boards should also be correctly saved and loaded.
9. A file with an invalid board should not be loadable.
10. There must be shapes with different parameter count (radius, width\height, height\angle).

In this example, the Student class encapsulates the name and age data members and provides getter 
and setter methods to access and modify them, respectively. :

   ```sh
  #include <iostream>
#include <vector>
// Define the size of the board
const int BOARD_WIDTH = 80;
const int BOARD_HEIGHT = 25;
// Struct to define the board
struct Board {
 std::vector<std::vector<char>> grid;
 Board() : grid(BOARD_HEIGHT, std::vector<char>(BOARD_WIDTH, ' ')) {}
 void print() {
 for (auto& row : grid) {
 for (char c : row) {
 std::cout << c;
 }
 std::cout << "\n";
 }
 }
 void drawTriangle(int x, int y, int height) {
 if (height <= 0) return; // Ensure the triangle height is positive and sensible
 for (int i = 0; i < height; ++i) {
 int leftMost = x - i; // Calculate the starting position
 int rightMost = x + i; // Calculate the ending position
 int posY = y + i; // Calculate the vertical position
 // Draw only the edges/border of the triangle
 if (posY < BOARD_HEIGHT) {
 if (leftMost >= 0 && leftMost < BOARD_WIDTH) // Check bounds for left
most position
 grid[posY][leftMost] = '*';
 if (rightMost >= 0 && rightMost < BOARD_WIDTH && leftMost != rightMost)
// Check bounds for right most position
 grid[posY][rightMost] = '*';
 }
 }
 // Draw the base of the triangle separately
 for (int j = 0; j < 2 * height - 1; ++j) {
 int baseX = x - height + 1 + j;
 int baseY = y + height - 1;
 if (baseX >= 0 && baseX < BOARD_WIDTH && baseY < BOARD_HEIGHT) // Check
bounds for each position on the base
 grid[baseY][baseX] = '*';
 }
 }
};
int main() {
 Board board;
 board.drawTriangle(10, 1, 5);
 board.print();
 return 0;
}
```

## Task milestones 
1. Design your  system on  the paper or by  using some online tools, please use squares and 
arrows to draw classes and their relations, no specific notation is needed in this task, think 
in advance how would your system look like. 
2. Implement the I/O system to parse input file, create a class for user input processing 
3. Implement logic to book the ticket, create appropriate classes and relations between them, 
consider effective data structures 
4. Implement logic to view booking results 
5. Test the solution, develop your own input data files 

## Control questions  

1. What is inheritance?
2. What is polymorphism? How can it be achieved?
3. What is operator overloading?
4. Which types of constructors do you know?
5. What does the virtual keyword mean?
6. What does the override keyword mean?
7. What does the final keyword mean? In which contexts it can be used?
8. What does the pure method mean?
9. When do we need virtual functions?
10. What is dynamic_cast and how is it implemented under the hood?
11. Explain the difference between unique_ptr and shared_ptr.
12. Explain the difference between shared_ptr and weak_ptr.
13. RAII idiom.

## Assessment üåü 
  - Usage of inheritance and polymorphism principles  - 4
  - The shape interface is uniform and strictly defined  - 2
  - The draw interface is the same for figures of all shapes and parameter count  - 2
  - There are 4 or more shapes available to the user (e.g. triangle, rectangle,
circle, line) - 1
  - All constraints are satisfied) - 1
- Test in Moodle - 1
