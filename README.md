# Shapes blackboard - assignment2

## Task üõ†Ô∏è

Develop a console-based application which will represent a shapes board with the ability to draw
different types of shapes on it. The main idea is that the user has an empty blackboard and can
interact with it in a few ways: show the blackboard, place or remove some shape within the
blackboard or clear it completely. Additionally, the user should be able to save and load the state
of the blackboard from the file

## Command-line Interface:

| Command  | Parameters      | Description                              | Result                                                    | Example              |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| draw     | -               | Draw blackboard to the console            | ASCII-drawn blackboard with all shapes on it, or empty     | `> draw`             |
| list     | -               | Print all added shapes with their IDs and parameters | List of all added shapes. One shape per line with shape ID and all information related to the shape | `> list` <br> `> id circle radius coordinates` <br> `> id square width height coordinates` |
| shapes   | -               | Print a list of all available shapes and parameters for the `add` command | List of all available shapes. One shape per line with shape info as defined by the student. | `> shapes` <br> `> circle radius coordinates` <br> `> square width height coordinates` |
| add      | shape parameters| Add shape to the blackboard               | Shape is added to the blackboard                           | `> add circle 10 10 5` |
| undo     | -               | Remove the last added shape from the blackboard | The last added shape is removed                          | `> undo`             |
| clear    | -               | Remove all shapes from the blackboard     | All shapes are removed from the blackboard                | `> clear`            |
| save     | file-path       | Save the blackboard to the file           | Blackboard is saved to the file. The state of the blackboard remains unchanged. | `> save D:\test.bb`  |
| load     | file-path       | Load a blackboard from the file           | Blackboard is loaded from the file. Previous state of the blackboard is cleared. | `> load D:\test.bb`  |






## Constrains: 
There are some constraints and preferences related to that task.
1. Shapes are drawn as frames.
2. Shapes can overlap. In that case, shapes should be correctly drawn.
3. Shapes cannot be placed outside of the board.
4. Shapes bigger than the board cannot be placed on the board.
5. Shapes that are partially outside of the board can be placed, but they are cropped.
6. Figures with the same type and parameters cannot be placed on the same spot.
7. There is no limit to the shape count on the board.
8. Empty boards should also be correctly saved and loaded.
9. A file with an invalid board should not be loadable.
10. There must be shapes with different parameter count (radius, width\height, height\angle).

arrows to draw classes and their relations, no specific notation is needed in this task, think 
in advance how would your system look like. 
2. Implement the I/O system to parse input file, create a class for user input processing 
3. Implement logic to book the ticket, create appropriate classes and relations between them, 
consider effective data structures

3. What is operator overloading?
4. Which types of constructors do you know?
5. What does the virtual keyword mean?
6. What does the override keyword mean?
7. What does the final keyword mean? In which contexts it can be used?
8. What does the pure method mean?
9. When do we need virtual functions?

# Shapes blackboard - assignment3

## Task üõ†Ô∏è

In this assignment, you should extend the blackboard that was already developed from the previous
assignment. This extension will be presented in the form of new commands, and the appearance
of new stricter requirements to the already developed parts.

## Constraints
In addition to previous constraints there are a new one:
1. Command must be read from the console as a whole. In other words, you should input the
command with all its arguments as a single string.
2. Now shapes can be drawn not only as a frame but also as a whole-filled figure.
3. Shapes on the board have an associated colour with them, which should be respected.
Shapes must be ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù with the first letter of their colour as a symbol.
4. A file with an invalid board should not be loadable.
5. All objects must be stored in a single array. This was not an explicit, but an implicit
requirement from the previous work. Here we just want to state it explicitly.
6. You can draw figures using real colours. In that case, there will be extra points for you.
You can use external libraries or your platform API for that one.




## Task milestones 

1. Carefully read the table and think about the corner case of the designed system.
2. Update the system design if needed.
3. Implement figures selecting logic, consider figure level (background, foreground,
middle).
4. Add figure removing functionality.
5. Implement figures filling with a colour (painting).
6. Add ability to edit figures parameters.
7. Implement moving logic of the figure.
8. Test your solution and prepare a report document.



## Assessment üåü 
  - Usage of inheritance and polymorphism principles including dynamic_cast
usage  - 4
  - Extended functionality is fully implemented  - 5
  - All constraints are satisfied  - 1
  - Extra points:real colours in the terminal -1
